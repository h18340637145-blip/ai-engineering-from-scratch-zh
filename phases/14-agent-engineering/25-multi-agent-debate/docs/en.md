# 多 Agent 辩论：消除幻觉与自我一致性检验

> 通过让多个具备不同 Prompt 或专长的 Agent 针对同一问题展开多轮辩论，显著降低幻觉并提高决策准确率。

**Type:** Learn + Build
**Languages:** Python (stdlib)
**Prerequisites:** Phase 14 Lesson 01, Lesson 05
**Time:** ~60 分钟

## 学习目标

- Explain the debate protocol: N proposers, R rounds, converge on a shared answer.
- Describe why debate improves factuality, rule-following, and reasoning.
- Explain sparse topology: not every debater needs to see every other.
- Implement a stdlib debate over a scripted LLM with full-mesh and sparse variants; measure token cost vs accuracy.

## 问题切入

Self-Refine (Lesson 05) is one model critiquing itself — risks groupthink. CRITIC (Lesson 05) grounds critique in external tools — not always available. Debate introduces a third mode: multiple instances, cross-critique, convergence by disagreement.

## 核心概念

### Society of Minds (Du et al., ICML 2024)

- N model instances independently propose answers to the same question.
- Over R rounds, each model reads the others' proposals and critiques them.
- Models update their answers based on the critiques.
- After R rounds, return the convergent answer.

Original experiments used N=3, R=2 due to cost. Accuracy improves with more agents and more rounds on hard problems (MMLU, GSM8K, Chess Move Validity, biography generation).

Cross-model combinations beat single-model debates: ChatGPT + Bard together > either alone.

### Sparse topology

"Improving Multi-Agent Debate with Sparse Communication Topology" (arXiv:2406.11776, 2024-2025) showed full-mesh debate is not always optimal. Sparse topologies (star, ring, hub-and-spoke) can match accuracy at lower token cost. Each debater sees only a subset of peers.

Implications:

- Full mesh N=5, R=3 = 5 × 3 = 15 proposals, each reading 4 peers = 60 critique ops.
- Star N=5, R=3 (one hub + 4 spokes) = 15 proposals, spokes read only the hub = 12 critique ops.

### When debate helps

- **Factuality.** N independent proposals, cross-check reduces hallucination.
- **Rule-following.** Chess move validity — one model misses a rule, others catch it.
- **Open-ended reasoning.** Multiple framings narrow in on the right answer.

### When debate hurts

- **Latency-sensitive UX.** N × R serial rounds is latency you may not have.
- **Cost-sensitive scale.** N × R tokens per question.
- **Simple factual lookups.** One lookup is cheaper than five debates.

### 2026 practical instantiations

- **Anthropic orchestrator-workers** (Lesson 12) — one variant of debate with a synthesis step.
- **LangGraph supervisor** (Lesson 13) — central router + specialist agents can implement debate as a node.
- **OpenAI Agents SDK** (Lesson 16) — agents handoff back and forth for iterative critique.
- **Multi-agent evals** — pair debate + evaluator-optimizer for eval signal.

### Where this pattern goes wrong

- **Convergence collapse.** All agents converge on the first wrong answer. Mitigate with required disagreement rounds.
- **Hub failure.** In a star topology, a bad hub corrupts everyone. Rotate or use multiple hubs.
- **Prompt homogenization.** All agents use the same prompt; they produce the same answers. Use diverse prompts and/or models.

## 动手实现

`code/main.py` implements stdlib debate:

- `Debater` class (scripted LLM with per-debater opinion drift).
- `FullMeshDebate` and `SparseDebate` runners.
- Three questions: one factual, one rule-based, one reasoning.
- Metrics: convergent answer, rounds to convergence, total critique ops.

Run it:

```
python3 code/main.py
```

Output: per-protocol accuracy and cost; sparse matches full mesh on 2/3 questions at lower cost.

## 应用场景

- **Anthropic orchestrator-workers** for simple 2-3-worker debates.
- **LangGraph** for stateful multi-round debate with checkpointing.
- **Custom** for research or specialized correctness guarantees.

## 产出成果

`outputs/skill-debate.md` scaffolds a multi-agent debate with configurable topology, N, R, and a convergence rule.

## 练习题

1. Implement a "forced disagreement" rule: in round 1, every debater must produce a distinct proposal. Measure effect on convergence speed.
2. Add a confidence-weighted aggregation: debaters return (answer, confidence); aggregator weights by confidence. Does it help?
3. Swap one "agent" for a different scripted LLM with different opinions. Does heterogeneity improve accuracy?
4. Measure token cost for full mesh vs sparse on your 3 questions. Plot cost vs accuracy.
5. Read the Society of Minds paper. Port your toy to N=5, R=3. What breaks? What gets better?
